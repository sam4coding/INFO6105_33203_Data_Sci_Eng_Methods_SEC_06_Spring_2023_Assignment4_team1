Summary of the movie "In our prime":
Jiwoo is a high school student who is struggling with his math. His math teacher suggested him to transfer to other schools. He found out that the security guard of the school, Mr. Hakseong, was the top mathematician of North Korea, who defected to South Korea. And Mr. Hakseong has solved the Riemann hypothesis, which will be the key to decode the current security system of the world. Mr. Hakseong took Jiwoo in and taught him math, as well as life lessons. He encouraged Jiwoo to love math and to believe only proven things. Jiwoo was framed by his math teacher to cover the teacher's academic misbehavior, but he chose not to sacrifice himself and accept the accusation of the math teacher in order to protect Mr. Hakseong. At the same time, Mr. Hakseong's true identity was exposed accidentally and he chose to flee away. Param, who was a girl of honest, texted Mr. Hakseong and woke him up. Mr. Hakseong decided to sacrifice his own life to protect Jiwoo. In the end, the math teacher was exposed and Mr. Hakseong was sent to Germany by the south Korea government for protection. Jiwoo studied hard and earned himself a chance to visit MPG to reunite with Mr. Hakseong.

Main story line:
Jiwoo is in a very high profile school where all the geniuses study. He is not very talented and suffers to score good grades in maths.He is at a danger of being transferred to a community school. A few days later, he is caught with a few bottles of beer and was removed from the dorm. Jiwoo's classmate Param feels unfair for Jiwoo. So she starts to have interest in this loser liked boy. The security guard who catches the boy realises that he has nowhere to go, so he lets him stay at his place. the guard sees the boy's homework and ends up solving it for him. the next day the boy aces in his math class. The boy tried to reach out to the guard so he can ask him for help with his math homework but all efforts are in vain. eventually, the guard gives up and takes the boy under his wing to teach him math. 

It turns out that this security guard, Mr. Hakseong, is a renounced mathematician in North Korean. He was a genius and he already solved the most challenging math problem in the world, the Reimann hypothesis, which, will give the key to decode any security code in the world. Knowing that The North Korean government will only use his math study for weapon development, and he would have no freedom for his math study, he decided to defect to South Korean, the enemy country and conceal his identity.  
With the help of the genius Mathematician, Jiwoo is progressing remarkably in math. Even Jiwoo's math teacher notices it. But he still did not like Jiwoo and was looking for a chance to transfer Jiwoo to other schools.

Jiwoo only continues to enjoy the tutoring of Mr. Hakseong and started to taste the mysterious sweetness and feel the unspeakable beauty of Math, as he works on numbers and plays with formulas. Also Param found her own way to this study group and she also enjoyed studying together. Jiwoo knows that Mr. Hakseong thirst for latest reports of math research in the world, so he went to school printer room to print a lot of math research papers for Mr. Hakseong to satisfy him. (Man! So nerdy!)

And there comes a big event. It is a Mathematics Olympia. The one who get any prize in this Olympia will be waived the college entrance exam. All the "genius" students in Jiwoo's class were interested in it, except for jiwoo, who never considered himself to be worthy of such competition. And the rule under the table is that those genius students will go to math training camps, such as "the Euler's camp" to be trained. And these training camp is the place where the Math teacher leaks the problems and solutions in the Mathematics Olympia to the "genius students". It's his filthy way of money making. Only wealthy students will afford it. Param's parents also send her to this camp. 

Finally, the day for the Olympia came. Param was so shocked to find that all the problems in the paper are from the training camp. Exactly the same ones! This is cheating! She is so upset that she decides to give up the competition. And she is so ashamed about the fact that she is involved in cheating and she locks herself up in depressed.


The news about Math Olympia question leakage goes public. The school principal needs an explanation from the Math teacher. The math teacher decides to use Jiwoo as the sacrificial lamb in order to cover for himself. The surveillance camera video shows that Jiwoo used the printer to print a big amount of documents, which is very suspicious. Jiwoo is accused to be the thief. 

##############################(Twisting of the story starts here:)#####################################
Even though Mr. Hakseong teaches Jiwoo an important lesson in math that he should not believe in anything unless he can prove it. This time Jiwoo cannot defend himself and is kicked out of the school. And he is transferred to a community school. 

But regardless of this he continues to take classes from the security guard and he does very well at his new school, making many friends and winning trust of his teachers.

##############################(returning to the original ending)###########################################
Mr. Hakseong decides to sacrifice himself for Jiwoo, by revealing himself publically in the awarding ceremony of the math Olympia and testifying that Jiwoo was printing math paper for him, not stealing. Also, Mr. Hakseong exposes the relationship between the math teacher and the "Euler's camp", making it known that it is the math teacher who leaked the questions on purpose for profit. The math teacher is speechless and defendless before him.

Thinking that very soon the North Korean agents will come again, Mr. Hakseong is still uncertain about his future. Here comes his old friend, who lives always nearby him, the recycle dealer, who is actually the secret South Korean agent assigned to protect Mr. Hakseong. He got the order from the government to send Mr. Hakseong to Germany, as the ultimate protection on him. 

...Jiwoo has his name washed clean and graduates from high school and becomes a math major student. He earns an opportunity for himself to vist the Max-Planck Gesellschaft in Germany, and finally he is able to reunite with Mr. Hakseong as fellow math reseachers. (The end)
